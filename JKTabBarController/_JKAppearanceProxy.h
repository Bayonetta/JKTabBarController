 JKAppearanceProxy is custom appearance for recoarding invocation from the class that inheird from NSObject but failed to excute UIAppearance protocol methods.
 Example:
 
 1.Overwrite UIAppearance protocol method
 + (instancetype)appearance{
    return [JKAppearanceProxy appearanceForClass:self];
 }
 
 2.Excute startForwarding at the right time.
 - (void)viewWillMoveToSuperView:(UIView *)superView{
    [super viewWillMoveToSuperView:superView];
    [[self appearance] startForwarding:self];
 }
 
 Done.
